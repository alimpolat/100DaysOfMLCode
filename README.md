# 100DaysOfMLCode

## The creation of this repository was inspired by Siraj Raval's challenge to code machine learning for at least an hour everyday for 100 days: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6420525903968825344

I nervously accepted this challenge in addition to working full time and taking 6 hours of graduate courseowrk in the 2018 summer semester. I will use this repository to store code, jupyter notebook examples, and thought processes.
