## NMF
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a method of dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and clustering. It has many applications in text mining, image analysis, bioinformatics, and even audio signal processing.

## RFE
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a method of reducing features with the use of any classifier model to first fully fit a model with all features, then recursively remove features and recalculate the model's accuracy.
