# Simple Linear Regression To-Do

## Define Simple Linear Regression (SLR):
1.	Define R-squared
    * Calculation – Interpretation - Use
    * Can R-squared be negative?
2.	Define modeling, refer: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/shmueli.pdf
    *	Define Explanatory modeling
      * Should SLR be used for Explanatory modeling
    * Define Predictive modeling
      * Define prediction - Should SLR be used for prediction, why or why not?
      * Should SLR be used for Predictive modeling
    *	Define Descriptive modeling
      * Should SLR be used for Descriptive modeling
3.	Define assumptions:
    *	Linearity
      * Define linearity
      * Python code to check
        * Residual plot – code & interpretation
      * R code to check
    *	Independence of errors
      * Define independence
        * Independence vs uncorrelated
      * Define what errors
      * Python code to check independence
      * R code to check
    *	Homoskedasticity, i.e. equal variance of errors
      * Define homoskedasticity
      * Python code to check
        * Residual plot – code & interpretation 
      * R code to check
    *	Normality of errors
      * Define Normality
      * Define what errors
      * Python code to check
        * Normal Q-Q plot
        * Histogram?
      * R code to check
4.	Compare Simple Linear Regression with Linear Regression by Gradient Descent
    *	What is Linear Regression by Gradient Descent
    *	Similarities – Differences 
      * Calculations, assumptions, uses
