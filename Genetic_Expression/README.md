This folder contains a project demontrating the analysis of gene expression using quantitative techniques such as 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goals of this project are:
* Explore and Explain how to spot "bad" genetic data.
* Methods for interpretting and using PCA results.
* A comparisson between analysis methods in R and in Python.
